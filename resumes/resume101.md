PII: Is there contact info to get in touch?
PII: Does the candidate list full address (House Number, etc etc or City, State?)
PII: Links to socials? (GitHub, Blog, website, Twitter, LinkedIN?)
Appeal: Does it catch the eye in a good way?
Appeal: In the first 5 Seconds of the review, do you see something you dont like or that looks off? Rejection phase of a resume sift.
Appeal: In the following 15 Seconds, do you see something standout on the resume that makes you want to look further?Acceptance part of a resume sift

Overall Structure
Dates: Is the date format centric throughout the resume? eg( MMM YYYY - MMM YYYY)
Dates: Do all the dates line up
Length: Simple. 1 Pager is great, 2 is fine, 3 is NOT.
Fonts: Is the same font used throughout the resume?
Job locations: Does the candidates current job location match the job at the top of the resume? If yes, it can be removed. If the candidates current job location, is different than the top PII part (People do this if they are working in location X, but want to be in location Y) then leave it.
Efficiency: Does the candidate use the space they have efficiently without wasting dead space or is the resume feel very cramped/bunched?
Titles: Ideally, if a candidates career is longer than 10-15 years, ensure their titles are 1 line, not over 2 lines
Titles: What does the candidate lead with on Titles? Job, Company or Company, Job?
Uniformity: Is the resume uniform is structure and layout throughout? (Having a uniformly structured resume helps a lazy recruiter train their eye onto where what is on the resume.)

Sellability
What does the candidate believe sells them best? Typically I feel there are 4 core aspects.
1.	Community Engagement: Speaker, Volt, Organizer, Workshopper at Sec Cons
2.	Experience: Does the candidate possess a true wealth of experience?
3.	Education: Did they attend and get a Masters+ from a uni like Johns Hopkins, Carnegie, MIT etc?
4.	Certifications: Does the candidate have some certs that are less common? OSCP is great, but do they also have OSCE, OSEE, OSEP, SANS GREM, GXPN etc?
NB: Candidate can lead with certs (Their best) towards the top of their resume, then have lesser LEET certs towards the end of the resume under “Further Certifications”

By understanding which of the top 4 points sells the candidate best, we would want them to lead with that from the resume, IE top to bottom. The 4 titles above represent sections

Fit for purpose
Fit for purpose: Does this resume fit the purpose it is intended for? Does it fit the type of role the candidate is looking for? 
Want to be a manager? Do they have soft skill stuff, people leadership skills, KPI talk, etc?
Summary: Summaries either add value or simply take up space. Is the candidate looking for a career move or a ladder climb? Are they TRANSITIONING (Military to Civilian, HelpDesk to Sec Analyst, Red team to blue team?) If the answer is YES, have a summary. If they are a Mid Level Pentester, looking for a Senior role, then the Summary is not needed.

Summary Stucture: Summaries can be formatted specifically. Ideally cover 4-5 points in 2-4 sentences.


1.	Where do you come from?
Not location wise. Where have you come from professionally? Where did this all start?
2.	What are you doing now?
What is your current role, without needing to rehash what will be listed below in Exp? Eg for a SOC Engineer “....I currently help build, scale and deploy advanced SIEM Solutions..”
3.	What do you want to be doing?:  What is the candidate working towards? Career change, growth, etc
4.	What are you doing NOW to get to where you WANT to go?: What is the candidate doing atm to get to their goal?
5.	Interesting Point: Community highlight, quirky hobby, big achievement

Why the above? By number


1.	This tells us what the backstory is
2.	Gives us an idea of what they are doing
3.	This shows desire to challenge, grow and excel
4.	Shows you are focussed and can make plans to follow
5.	Something to remember you by




Basics
Spelling:
Grammar:
Length:
Content: Does the candidate elaborate on the jobs that mattered? IE their most recent, or the last 3? Or do they have 1-2 bullets for their current role, after 10 bullets for a job 15 years ago?
Longevity: Experience is always valuable. If the candidate has had a career longer that 10 years, “1 Line” titles prior to the 10 years. 
Stints: Does the candidates resume show a candidate that has some resemblance of being loyal or do the hop jobs?
Stints: Has the candidates resume come to you within 12 months of starting a job?
The Test: Does the content of the resume represent you as the best candidate for an open req? Does every bullet point and sentence add value to your resume? If you need to save space, one must review each bullet and thing to oneself “Does this bullet point truly add value to my candidacy?”

Missing Value
Community: Is the candidate involved within the security community? If they are, is it on the resume? If not, why? This is LOST VALUE
Blog: Does the candidate have a professional blog, GitHub, Stack Overflow that adds value that is NOT included on their resume?

Security Aware?
Client information: Does the candidate disclose current or recent clients SPECIFICALLY? 
PII: Does the candidate disclose too much PII that is unnecessary?
Stack in use: Does the candidate share too much information to the stack, services and infrastructure they are currently using at their employer? This is a unneeded risk.
